## Adding user online

You can create a user account online:

1. Go to https://developers.datenstrom.se/tests/new-user
2. Follow instructions to create user account.

## Adding user via command line

You can add a user account from the [command line](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/commandline):

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Go to your Yellow installation, where the `yellow.php` is.
3. Type the following line: `php yellow.php user email@example.com horsebattery`  
4. Now you can login with `email@example.com` and password `horsebattery`.

All users are stored in file `system/config/user.ini`. The configuration file uses the format `email: password hash, name, language, status, home`. Most entries should be self-explaining, the password is stored as encrypted bcrypt hash, at the end is the user's home page. Users can not change pages outside their home page.

## Adding user via web browser

Do you want to create user accounts on your own website? Isn't it strange that you have to read this instructions. You're absolutely right. We are open for [suggestions](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/issues).
