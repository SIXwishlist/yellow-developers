Here's how to set up a website with different languages.

## Languages

Yellow is multilingual and there are [language files](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/language) you can download. The default language is defined in file `system/config/config.ini`. A different language can be defined in the [settings](markdown-cheat-sheet#settings) at the top of each page, for example `Language: en`.

Here's an English page:

```
---
Title: About us
Language: en
---
Birds of a feather flock together.
```

A German page:

```
---
Title: Über uns
Language: de
---
Wo zusammenwächst was zusammen gehört.
```

A French page:

```
---
Title: À propos de nous
Language: fr
---
Oiseaux du même plumage volent ensemble.
```

## Multi language mode

If you want to translate an entire website, it's best to use the multi language mode. Open file `system/config/config.ini` and change `MultiLanguageMode: 1`. Go to your `content` folder and create a new folder for each language. Here's an example:

The first screenshot shows the folders `1-en`, `2-de` and `3-fr`. This gives you the URLs `http://website/` `http://website/de/` `http://website/fr/` for English, German and French. Here's another example:

The second screenshot shows the folders `1-en`, `2-de`, `3-fr` and `default`. This gives you the URLs `http://website/en/` `http://website/de/` `http://website/fr/` and a home page `http://website/` that automatically detects the visitor's language. 

To adjust the [navigation](yellow-templates#custom-navigation) open file `system/config/config.ini` and change `Navigation: navigation-multilanguage`. You can also show a language selection somewhere else on your website, for example in the [footer](yellow-templates#custom-footer).
