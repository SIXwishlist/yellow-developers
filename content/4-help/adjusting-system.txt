All settings are located in the `system` folder. You can adjust your website here.

The `config` folder contains configuration files. The `plugins` folder contains the Yellow software. The `themes` folder is for the visual design of your website. Changes in these folders affect the entire website.

## System settings

The main configuration file is `system/config/config.ini`. Here's an example:

    Sitename: Anna Svensson Design
    Author: Anna Svensson
    Email: anna@svensson.com
    Language: en
    Theme: flatsite

You can define the default settings of your website here. Individual [settings](markdown-cheat-sheet#settings) can be defined at the top of each page. For a new installation you should set `Sitename`, `Author` and `Email`.

When there are problems an error page is shown. When a web browser requests a file that the web server cannot find your website will show a “File not found” page. The file `system/config/page-error-404.txt` defines how a missing file looks like.

## Plugins and themes

Yellow concentrates on the essential aspects. You get the most important things to make websites and can add more features. For example a search or an image gallery. There are [plugins](/plugins/) and [themes](/themes/) you can download.
