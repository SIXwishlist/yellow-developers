All settings are located in the `system` folder. You can adjust your website here.

The `config` folder contains configuration files. The `plugins` folder contains the Yellow software. The `themes` folder is for the visual design of your website. Changes in these folders affect the entire website.

## System settings

The main configuration file is `system/config/config.ini`. Here's an example:

    Sitename: Anna Svensson Design
    Author: Anna Svensson
    Email: anna@svensson.com
    Language: en
    Theme: flatsite

You can define the default settings here, for example the name of the website and the email of the webmaster. Individual [settings](markdown-cheat-sheet#settings) can be defined at the top of each page. For a new installation you should set `Sitename`, `Author` and `Email`. 

## User accounts

All user accounts are stored in file `system/config/user.ini`. Here's an example:

    anna@svensson.com: $2y$10$j26zDnt/xaWxC/eqGKb9p.d6e3pbVENDfRzauTawNCUHHl3CCOIzG,Anna,en,active,946684800,none,/
    demo@demo.com: $2y$10$8TKEuytrwiLSICJNlW5.yOE9CQPXJmqXL2Af6rPsSch1/9UiXEZjm,Yellow,en,active,946684800,none,/
    guest@guest.com: $2y$10$4VENNhK/hb3US8zJdimJduratVuQloACbdmbGhoFUyqHvU6mbpPm.,Guest,en,active,946684800,none,/tests/

You can use the [web interface](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/webinterface) to create new user accounts and change passwords. A user account consists of email, encrypted password, user settings and at the end of the line is the user's home page. 

To restrict a user account define a home page for the user. Users are not allowed to change pages outside their own home page. The `Guest` user account for example is only allowed to change `/tests/` pages.

## Plugins and themes

Yellow concentrates on the essential aspects. You get the most important things to create a small website and can add more features. How about a blog or an image gallery? There are [plugins](/plugins/) and [themes](/themes/) you can download.
