Here's how to set up a website with better security.

## Secure server

Check if your web server supports [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) and if the Internet connection is encrypted. It's best if your website is only available via HTTPS. This protects your user account from being stolen, but it's not supported by every web hosting provider.

You need a web server with SSL/TLS and valid certificate.

## User restrictions

If you have more than one person editing a website, restrict [user accounts](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/webinterface) and only parts of the website can be changed. This protects your website from being changed in a web browser, but it doesn't prevent changes in the file system.  

All users are stored in file `system/config/user.ini`. A user account consists of email, encrypted password, name, language, status and at the end is the user's home page. Users can not change pages outside their home page. 

You can [test user restrictions](http://developers.datenstrom.se), log in with `guest@guest.com` + `guest`.

## Safe mode

If you have more than one person editing a website, enable safe mode and only [Markdown](markdown-cheat-sheet) is possible for text formatting. This protects your website from unwanted content, but it also disables HTML and JavaScript in page content.

Open file `system/config/config.ini` and change `ParserSafeMode: 1`.
