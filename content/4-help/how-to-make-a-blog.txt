Learn how to make a blog with Yellow.

## Install blog

[Download and install the blog plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/blog).

Your blog is immediately available as `http://website/blog/` or `http://website/`, depending on how you configure your `content` folder. If you want the blog on your home page, rename the blog folder to '1-blog' and delete '1-home'.

The main configuration for your blog is file `system/config/config.ini`. You can define the [default settings](changing-settings#settings) of your website here. Individual settings can be defined at the top of each page. There are [plugins](/plugins/) and [themes](/themes/) you can download.
 
## Writing blog pages

Have a look inside your `content` folder, there's the blog folder with all your blog pages. Open the file `2013-04-07-blog-example.txt`. You'll see settings and text of the page. You can change `Title` and other [settings](markdown-cheat-sheet#settings) at the top of a page. Here's an example:

```
---
Title: Blog example
Published: 2013-04-07
Author: Yellow
Tag: Example
---
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod 
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna pizza. Ut enim ad minim veniam, 
quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo. 
```

To create a new blog page, add a new file to the blog folder. Set `Published` and more settings at the top of a page. Dates should be written in the format YYYY-MM-DD. The publishing date will be used to sort blog pages. You can use `Tag` to group similar pages together. Here's another example:

```

Title: Fika is good for you
Published: 2013-06-01

Tag: Example, Coffee

Fika is a Swedish custom. It's a social coffee break where people 
gather to have a cup of coffee or tea together. You can have fika with 
colleagues at work. You can invite your friends to fika. Fika is such 
an important part of life in Sweden that it is both a verb and a noun. 
Do you fika?
```

Now let's add a video with the [Youtube plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/youtube):

You can write blog pages in [Markdown](markdown-cheat-sheet).

## Creating a sidebar

To create a sidebar add the file `sidebar.txt` to your blog folder. The sidebar 
is automatically shown on all blog pages. Here's an example sidebar:

```
---
Title: Sidebar
Status: hidden
---
Links

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/datenstromse)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/datenstrom)
```

You can use [shortcuts](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/blog#how-to-configure-a-blog) to show information about the blog. Here's another example:

```
---
Title: Sidebar
Status: hidden

[blogrecent /blog/]

[blogarchive /blog/]
```
