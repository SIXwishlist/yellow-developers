All media is located in the `media` folder. You can store your images and other files here.

All `media` folders are available on your website. The `downloads` folder contains files to download. The `images` folder is the place to store your images. For a small website put all images inside this folder. You can also create additional folders and organise files as you like.

## Images

Here's how to use images on a page. Open the file `content/1-home/page.txt` in your favorite text editor and add `![image](picture.jpg)` to the text of the page. The home page shows now a beautiful image. 

`![image](picture.jpg)` shows  `http://website/media/images/picture.jpg`  

You can also use the [image plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/image) to resize images and create thumbnails.

`[image picture.jpg]` shows `http://website/media/images/picture.jpg`  

Images in different styles:

    [image picture.jpg Picture left]
    [image picture.jpg Picture centre]
    [image picture.jpg Picture right]

Images in different sizes:

    [image picture.jpg Picture - 64 64]
    [image picture.jpg Picture - 320 200]
    [image picture.jpg Picture - 50%]

## Videos

You can use the [Youtube plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/youtube) and [Vimeo plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/vimeo) to embed videos.
