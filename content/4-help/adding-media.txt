All media is located in the `media` folder. You can store your images and other files here.

The `downloads` folder contains files to download. The `images` folder is the place to store your images. For a small website put all images inside this folder. You can also create additional folders and organise files as you like. The `thumbnails` folder contains image thumbnails.

## Images

Let's try out how to use images. Open the file `content/1-home/page.txt` in your favorite text editor and add `[image picture.jpg]` to the text of the page. The page will now show the file `media/images/picture.jpg`. 

You can use the [image plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/image) to embed images:

    [image picture.jpg]
    [image picture.jpg Picture]
    [image picture.jpg "This is an example image"]

Images in different styles:

    [image picture.jpg Picture left]
    [image picture.jpg Picture centre]
    [image picture.jpg Picture right]

Images in different sizes:

    [image picture.jpg Picture - 64 64]
    [image picture.jpg Picture - 320 200]
    [image picture.jpg Picture - 50%]

## Audio

You can use the [Soundcloud plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/soundcloud) to embed audio:

    [soundcloud 101175715]
    [soundcloud 101175715 left 200 166]
    [soundcloud 101175715 right 200 166]

## Video

You can use the [Youtube plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/youtube) to embed videos:

    [youtube fhs55HEl-Gc]
    [youtube fhs55HEl-Gc left 200 112]
    [youtube fhs55HEl-Gc right 200 112]
