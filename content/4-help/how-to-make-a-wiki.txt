Learn how to make a wiki with Yellow.

## Install wiki

1. [Download and install Yellow](how-to-make-a-website).
2. [Download and install wiki plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/wiki).
3. Open your website in a web browser.

Your wiki is immediately available as `http://website/wiki/`. To make the wiki your home page, go to your `content` folder, rename the wiki folder to '1-wiki' and delete '1-home'. This is just an example to get you started, change everything as you like.

The main configuration file is `system/config/config.ini`. You can define the default settings of your website here. Individual settings can be defined at the top of each page. There are [plugins](/plugins/) and [themes](/themes/) you can download.

When your wiki doesn't work, please check the [web server configuration](web-server-configuration).

## Writing wiki pages

Have a look inside your `content` folder, there's the wiki folder with all your wiki pages. Open the file `wiki-page.txt`. You'll see settings and text of the page. You can change `Title` and other [settings](markdown-cheat-sheet#settings) at the top of a page. Here's an example:

```
---
Title: Wiki page
Tag: Example
---
An example wiki page. 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod 
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna pizza. Ut enim ad minim veniam, 
quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo. 
```

To create a new wiki page, add a new file to the wiki folder. Set `Title` and more settings at the top of a page. You can use `Tag` to group similar pages together. Here's another example:

```
---
Title: How to make coffee
Tag: Example, Coffee
---
Coffee is a beverage made from the roasted beans of the coffee plant.

1. Start with fresh coffee. Coffee beans start losing quality immediately 
after roasting and grinding. The best coffee is made from beans ground 
right after roasting. 
2. Brew a cup of coffee. Coffee is prepared with different methods and 
additional flavorings such as milk and sugar. There are Espresso, Filter 
coffee, French press, Moka pot, Turkish coffee and many more. Find out 
what's your favorite.
3. Enjoy.
```

You can write wiki pages in [Markdown](markdown-cheat-sheet).

## Creating a sidebar

To create a sidebar open the file `sidebar.txt` in your wiki folder. The sidebar 
is automatically shown on all wiki pages. Here's an example sidebar:

```
---
Title: Sidebar
Status: hidden
---
* [Recent changes](/wiki/special:changes/)  
* [Example](/wiki/tag:example/)  
```

You can use [shortcuts](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/wiki#how-to-configure-a-wiki) to show information about the wiki. Here's another example:

```
---
Title: Sidebar
Status: hidden
---

[wikirecent /wiki/ 3]

* [Example](/wiki/tag:example/)
