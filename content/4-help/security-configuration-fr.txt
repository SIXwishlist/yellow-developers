Here's how to set up a website with better security.

## Secure server

Check if your web server supports [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) and if the Internet connection is encrypted. It's best if your website is only available via HTTPS. This protects the privacy of your users, but it's not supported by every web hosting provider.

You need a web server with TLS and valid certificate.

## User restrictions

If you have more than one person editing a website, restrict [user accounts](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/webinterface) and only parts of the website can be changed. This protects your website from being changed in a web browser, but it doesn't prevent changes via FTP and SSH.

All user accounts are stored in file `system/config/user.ini`. A user account consists of email, encrypted password and [at the end](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-developers/blob/master/system/config/user.ini) is the user's home page. Users can not change pages outside their home page.

You can [test user restrictions](https://developers.datenstrom.se/edit/), log in with `guest@guest.com` + `guest`.

## Safe mode

If you have more than one person editing a website, enable safe mode and only [Markdown](markdown-cheat-sheet) is possible for text formatting. This protects your website from unwanted content and nuisance, but it also disables HTML and JavaScript in page content.

Open file `system/config/config.ini` and change `ParserSafeMode: 1`.

## Less is more

If there's nobody editing a website in a web browser, it's possible to run Yellow as pure flat-file CMS and static site generator. For example delete the [web interface](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/webinterface) and unused plugins. Then nobody can log in and change your website.

Delete file `system/plugins/webinterface.php` to remove the user login.
