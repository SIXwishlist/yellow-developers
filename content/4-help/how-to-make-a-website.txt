Learn how to make a website with Yellow. 

## Install website

[Download and install Yellow](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/).

Your website is immediately available. The installation of Yellow comes with two pages, 'Home' and 'About'. They are just an example to get you started, change them as you like. You can create your website by adding more files and folders.

The main configuration for your website is file `system/config/config.ini`. You can define the default settings of your website here. For a new installation you should set `Sitename`, `Author`, `Email` and `Language`. There are [plugins](/plugins/) and [themes](/themes/) you can download.

## Writing web pages

Have a look inside your `content` folder, here are all your web pages. Open the file `content/1-home/page.txt`. You'll see settings and text of the page. You can change `Title` and other [settings](markdown-cheat-sheet#settings) at the top of a page. Here's an example:

```
---
Title: Home
---
Your website works! 

You can now [edit this page] or use your text editor. 
```

To create a new page, add a new file to the home folder or another `content` folder. Set the `Title` at the top of a page. To add something to the navigation, create a new folder with a numerical prefix. The prefix defines the position in the navigation. Here's another example:

```
---
Title: Yellow is for people who make websites
---
You can [edit this page]. The help gives you more information 
about how to create small web pages, blogs and wikis.
```

Now let's add an image with the [image plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/image):

```
---
Title: Yellow is for people who make websites
---
[image yellow.jpg]

You can [edit this page]. The help gives you more information 
about how to create small web pages, blogs and wikis.
```

Let's show a different title in the navigation:

```
---
Title: Yellow is for people who make websites
TitleNavigation: Home
---
[image yellow.jpg]

You can [edit this page]. The help gives you more information 
about how to create small web pages, blogs and wikis.
```

You can write pages in [Markdown](markdown-cheat-sheet).

## Creating a sidebar

To create a sidebar add the file `sidebar.txt` to a `content` folder. The sidebar 
is automatically shown on all pages in the same folder. Here's an example sidebar:

```
---
Title: Sidebar
Status: hidden
