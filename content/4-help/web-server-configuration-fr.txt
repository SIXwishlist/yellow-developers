Comment faire configurer [des serveurs web](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/) différents.

## Apache

The `.htaccess` configuration file for the [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) web server:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on

DirectoryIndex index.html yellow.php
RewriteRule ^(cache|content|system)/ error [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ yellow.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

When your website doesn't work, please check the following steps. If Yellow has been installed in a subfolder, you should add `RewriteBase` to your configuration file. This will fix most web server problems. Here's an example:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /yellow/
DirectoryIndex index.html yellow.php
RewriteRule ^(cache|content|system)/ error [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ yellow.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

When your website still doesn't work, please check the Apache web server. If Yellow has been installed on a selfhosted web server, you have to enable the [rewrite module](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18740419/how-to-set-allowoverride-all) and configure `AllowOverride All` in the web server. 

Make sure that the web server can read and write files. You can manually adjust [file permissions](http://superuser.com/questions/51838/recursive-chmod-rw-for-files-rwx-for-directories) so that the web server can overwrite files, for example with command `chmod -R a+rw *`. As an alternative you can assign the group `www-data` and `umask 002` to the web server and users.

## Nginx

The `nginx.conf` configuration file for the [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) web server:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name website.com;
    root /var/www/website/;
    index index.html yellow.php;

    location /cache {
        rewrite ^(.*)$ /error break;
    }

    location /content {
        rewrite ^(.*)$ /error break;
    }

    location /system {
        rewrite ^(.*)$ /error break;
    }

    location / {
        if (!-e $request_filename) {
            rewrite ^/(.*)$ /yellow.php last;
            break;
        }
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_index yellow.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

## Static website

Yellow is a flat-file CMS and a static site generator. As a static site generator, it offers a build command that you can run from within a folder containing the Yellow installation. It then generates a completely static website, that works on any web server.

You can create a static website from the [command line](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/commandline). 

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Go to your Yellow installation, where the `yellow.php` is.
3. Type the following line: `php yellow.php build /var/www/website`

This will build a static website in folder `/var/www/website`. Upload the folder to your web hosting and build a new version when needed. The settings of your website are defined in file `system/config/config.ini`.

As an alternative to a static website you can also add individual pages to the cache. Here's an example: `php yellow.php build cache /blog/blog-example`. To clean the cache type the following line: `php yellow.php clean cache`.

## Error page

When there are problems an error page is shown. When a web browser requests a file that the web server cannot find your website will show a “File not found”  page. The file `system/config/page-error-404.txt` defines how a missing file looks like:

~~~~
---
Title: File not found
---
The requested file was not found. Oh no...
~~~~

If you use Yellow as a flat-file CMS there's nothing more to do. If you use Yellow to create a static website there's one additional step. Configure your web server to display your custom error page instead of its default 404 page. 

For [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) add the following to your configuration file:

    ErrorDocument 404 /404.html

For [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) add the following to your configuration file:

    error_page 404 /404.html;
