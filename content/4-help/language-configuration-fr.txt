Here's how to set up a website with different languages.

## Languages

Yellow is multilingual and there are [language files](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/language) you can download. The [default language](adjusting-system#settings) is defined in file `system/config/config.ini`. A different language can be defined in the [settings](markdown-cheat-sheet#settings) at the top of each page, for example `Language: en`.

Here's an English page:

```
---
Title: About us
Language: en
---
Birds of a feather flock together.
```

A German page:

```
---
Title: Über uns
Language: de
---
Wo zusammenwächst was zusammen gehört.
```

A French page:

```
---
Title: À propos de nous
Language: fr
---
Oiseaux du même plumage volent ensemble.
```

## Single language mode

If you speak only one language or want to translate only single pages, use the single language mode. This mode is automatically used after the installation of Yellow. The [default language](adjusting-system#settings) is defined in file `system/config/config.ini`.

The screenshot shows the `content` folder.

## Multi language mode

If you want to translate the whole website, it's best to use the multi language mode. Open file `system/config/config.ini` and change `MultiLanguageMode: 1`. Create a new folder `1-en` in your `content` folder and move all your content inside.

The screenshot shows the folders `1-en`, `2-de` and `3-fr`. This gives you the following URLs `http://website/` `http://website/de/` `http://website/fr/` for English, German and French. Here's another configuration:

The screenshot shows the folders `1-en`, `2-de`, `3-fr` and `default`. This gives you the following URLs `http://website/en/` `http://website/de/` `http://website/fr/` and a home page `http://website/` that automatically detects the visitor's language. 

If you want to use a [custom navigation](yellow-templates#custom-navigation), open file `system/config/config.ini` and change `Navigation: navigation-multilanguage`. You can also add a language selection somewhere on your website.
